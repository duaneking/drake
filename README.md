# Why Put This Work in?

People like Elon Musk are getting a lot of attention because of their advances for Space Flight, but I don't believe that we're putting enough effort as a civilization into realizing that the Drake equation is only the first part of the calculations we need to do to assure that human life will be consistent and available if we ever meet such a civilization that can communicate with us.

In short, The search for extra terrestrial life is only the first part of that. We should also be doing the work needed to make sure that we can protect and defend ourselves from them if they end up to be hostile.

I find it interesting that a number of scientists are refusing to ask the question of if that civilization will be hostile or not.

This seems far more important to me than if we can communicate with them or detect their signals.

I fully support the search for extraterrestrial life, but I also question what happens after they find us.
